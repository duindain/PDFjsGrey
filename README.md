# PDFjsGrey
PDF js solution using Xamarin forms with an issue rendering PDF's as grey/disabled on multiple loads until finall rendering correctly

I've added a screenshot once opening the app and downloading the PDF it opens and is greyed out and looks disabled and is very hard to read
Reloading the same PDF multiple times eventually renders as expected

This seems to be happening frequently on various devices and Android emulators

I am currently using Android 9 API 28 emulator
Xamarin Forms 4.1.0.555618
PDF.js pdfjs-2.1.266-dist
